# About Us

Marina and Josh both went to Franklin County High School, though we didn't
actually meet during our one-year overlap. Marina was a friend of Amelia, who
introduced them, and they started dating in 2012. Marina was in her junior
year of high school at the time, and Josh was in his sophomore year of
college at the University of Louisville.

### A Change of Schools

Marina's dream school had been the University of Southern California in LA
for some time, so she was thrilled when she was accepted there.
Unfortunately, this was going to require some time apart. Nevertheless, they
decided to try to make it work, all the while concocting a plan to end the
long-distance separation.

### A New Job

After a long year and a half of long-distance, and numerous cross-country
flights to visit, Josh graduated from U of L and found a job at a software
security startup in LA and a little apartment across the street from the
Staples Center. Piling everything he owned into his little Corolla, he
trekked across the country, driving 30 hours in the move from Louisville to
LA.

### Another Graduation

In 2017, Marina graduated from USC with her sights set on Medical School at
the University of Virginia. Once again, belongings were piled into a vehicle
to embark on yet another cross-country drive. This time, however, a moving
truck was required, and more stops along the way were planned. They drove the
truck from LA to Frankfort, KY, and then to Charlottesville, Virginia,
stopping at five national parks along the way. They now reside in
Charlottesville where Marina is a Med student and Josh works from home at the
same job he got when moving to LA.

## Regem belli facta lyncas cruoris inplet

Lorem markdownum constitit oculis dixit coitusque est imbres omnes non
resupinum! Qui [ter amens](http://egissem.org/cocinthia-chironis): rostro
stellarum formosior esse Erysicthona inque, Scythicae tamen in petit tuis
[ita](http://www.faciemet.net/alto-miratur.html), passim ille. Et membra
nurumque in favore, et fata aures quidem natus saepe admirantibus erat latet
torpetis illuc recens animos. **Dedimus umeros**; de sole, sed talibus color.

## Unum Iove forte manu coniunx

Sic cepere his *taedia in femina* mulcebant emicuit sua spem vino terrore
praeterita iudice cycnorum sibi cratere. Remisit matre ut *moratum vallem buxum*
plectrumque quas, signo. Se fractus et *manu*.

Ante mihi magnanimus artes, pari: caret eris saepibus, spicea! Videres
ruricolasque Pygmalion fortius solida et in illa iuvenalia, minus!
