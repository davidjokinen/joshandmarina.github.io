# About Us

Marina and Josh both went to Franklin County High School, though we didn't
actually meet during our one-year overlap. Marina was a friend of Amelia, who
introduced them, and they started dating in 2012. Marina was in her junior
year of high school at the time, and Josh was in his sophomore year of
college at the University of Louisville.

### A Change of Schools

Marina's dream school had been the University of Southern California in LA
for some time, so she was thrilled when she was accepted there.
Unfortunately, this was going to require some time apart. Nevertheless, they
decided to try to make it work, all the while concocting a plan to end the
long-distance separation.

### A New Job

After a long year and a half of long-distance, and numerous cross-country
flights to visit, Josh graduated from U of L in December, 2014 and found a
job at a software security startup in LA and a little apartment across the
street from the Staples Center. Piling everything he owned into his little
Corolla, he trekked across the country, driving 30 hours in the move from
Louisville to LA.

### A New Family Member

In 2015, they took a chance a new member of the family from the Harbor Animal
Shelter in Long Beach: Maxwell, the lovable
Poodle-Bichon-but-we're-not-really-sure dog! Quiet, cuddly, and non-shedding,
he turned out to be the perfect apartment dog and was small enough to fit
under the seats on the frequent flights home to visit family.

### Another Graduation and Engagement

In 2017, Marina graduated from USC with her sights set on Medical School at
the University of Virginia. During their post-graduation vacation to the
island of Kauai, Josh proposed at sunset along the beach. After the trip,
belongings were once again piled into a vehicle to embark on yet another
cross-country drive. This time, however, a moving truck was required, and
more stops along the way were planned. They drove the truck from LA to
Frankfort, KY, and then to Charlottesville, Virginia, stopping at five
national parks along the way. They now reside in Charlottesville where Marina
is a Med student, Josh works from home at the same job he got when moving to
LA, and Max is incredibly happy to laze on the couch when not zooming around
the apartment.
